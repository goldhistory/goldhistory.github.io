<p style="text-align:center;">The <abbr title="New Zealand Gold Rush">NZGR</abbr> started in 1861 at Gabriels Gully.</p>

<h1 id="p01" style="text-align:center;">Gabriels Gully</h1>

<p style="text-align:center;">Gabriel's Gully was the start of the major gold rush. The first gold found there was found by Mr. Gabriel Reid. This is why it is still called Gabriel's Gully today.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Gabriel's Gully was about 60 miles from Dunedin. Because of this, most of the population of Dunedin went there to look for their fortunes.</p> 

<h1 id="p01" style="text-align:center;">The Old Prospecting Tools</h1>

<p style="text-align:center;">There were two main tools that people took to the goldfields was a gold pan and a shovel, even though there were lots of other key tools
there was also lots of other tools including a tent, food and many other things. One other tool that the experienced miners used was called a gold cradle or rocker box. it was used to
process dirt faster.</p>

<h1 id="p01" style="text-align:center;">Where the Gold Rush moved after Gabriel's Gully </h1>

<p style="text-align:center;">After Gabriel's Gully, Horatio Hartly and Christopher Reilly recovered 1000oz on the Clutha River near Clyde. In 1863, the river rose causing 
  miners to prospect futher outwards into the vallies around them</p>
<h1 id="p01" style="text-align:center;">Later on in the gold rush </h1>

<p style="text-align:center;">After the Otago Goldrush had settled down, a little bit in 1864 the West Coast rush started.</p>

  <h1 id="p01" style="text-align:center;">The West Coast gold rush</h1>
  <p style="text-align:center;">In 1864 two Maori Ihaia Tainui and Haimona Taukau discovered gold near the Taramakau River. A few years later
  gold was discovered around Okarito and bruce bay with miners looking for their fortunes among the black sand beaches.later
  in 1909 Messrs Scott and Sharpe discovered the biggest gold nugget in New Zealand Weighing in at 3.09 kg (99.63 ounces) 
  worth around $170000 modern NZ dollars but even though it was worth that much money it was nothing to the hello stranger nugget Weighing in at 97.14 kilograms (3123 ozt). worth 6466602.47 modern NZ dollars.

<h1 id="p01" style="text-align:center;">Robbers and Claim Jumpers</h1>
<p style="text-align:center;">Robbers were the people that stole Gold off the Miners. This is one reason why the Miners had to keep quiet about their Gold
  Claim Jumpers were the other type of Robber. Claim Jumpers usually came in groups, unlike Robbers. When Claim Jumpers heard about Somebody that was finding Lots of Gold
they would go to that claim and either the miner would give it up or the Claim Jumpers would take it by force which did not usually end well for the miners.   </p>
