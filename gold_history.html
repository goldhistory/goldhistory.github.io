<p>The <abbr title="New Zealand Gold Rush">NZGR</abbr> started in 1861 at Gabriels Gully.</p>

<h1 id="p01">Gabriels Gully</h1>

<p>Gabriel's Gully was the start of the major gold rush. The first gold found there was found by Mr. Gabriel Reid. This is why it is still called Gabreil's Gully today.</p>
<p>Gabriel's Gully was about 60 miles from Dunedin. Because of this, most of the population of Dunedin went there to look for their fortunes.</p>

<p>There were two main tools that people took to the gold fields was a gold pan and a shovel, even thogh there was lots of other key tools
there was also lots of other tools including a tent, food and many other things. One other tool that the experinced miners used was called a gold cradle or rocker box. it was used to
process dirt faster.</p>

<h1 id="p01">Where the Gold Rush moved after Gabriel's Gully </h1>

<p>After Gabriel's Gully, Horatio Hartly and Christopher Reilly recovered 1000oz on the Clutha River near Clyde. In 1863, the river rose causing 
  miners to prospect futher outwards into the vallies around them</p>

<p>After the Otago Gold rush had settled down, a little bit in 1864 the West Coast rush started.</p>

<h1 id="p01">Robbers and Claim Jumpers</h1>
<p>Robbers were the people that stole Gold off the Miners. This is one reason why the Miners had to keep quiet about their Gold
  Claim Jumpers were the other type of Robber. Claim Jumpers usually came in groups, unlike Robbers. When Claim Jummpers heard about Sombody that was finding Lots of Gold
they would go to that claim and either the miner would give it up or the Claim Jumpers would take it by force whitch did not usually end well for the miners.   </p>
