<p>The <abbr title="New Zealand Gold Rush">NZGR</abbr> started in the 1860s at Gabriels Gully.</p>

<h1 id="p01">Gabriels Gully</h1>

<p>Gabriels Gully was the start of the major Gold Rush. The first Gold found there was found by Mr Gabriel Reid. This is why it is still called Gabreils Gully today.</p>
<p>Gabriels Gully was about 60 miles from Duniden. Because of this  most of the popultion of Duniedun went there to look for there fortunes.</p>

<p>There were two main tools that people took to the Gold Fields was a Gold Pan and a Shovel even thogh there was lots of other key tools
there was also lots of other tools including a Tent Food and many other things. One other tool that the experinced miners used was called a Gold Cradle or Rocker Box. it was used to
process dirt faster </p>

<h1 id="p01">Where the Gold Rush moved after Gabriels Gully </h1>

<p>After Gabriels Gully Horatio Hartly and Christopher Reilly recovered 1000 oz on the Clutha River near Clyde.In 1863 the River rose causing 
  miners to prospect futher outwards into the Vallys around them</p>
<h1 id="p01">Later on in the gold rush </h1>

<p>after the Otago Gold rush had settled down the West Coast rush started.</p>
<h1 id="p01">Robbers and Claim Jumpers</h1>
<p>Robbers were the people that stole Gold off the Miners. This is one reason why the Miners had to keep quiet about their Gold
  Claim Jumpers were the other type of Robber Claim Jumpers usually came in groups. Unlike Robbers. When Claim Jummpers heard about Sombody that was finding Lots of Gold
they would go to that Claim and either the miner would give it up or the Claim Jumpers would take it by force whitch did not usually end well for he miners.   </p>
