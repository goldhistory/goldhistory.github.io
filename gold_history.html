<p>there were two main tools that people took to the gold fields was a gold pan and a shovel even thogh there was lots of other key tools
there was also lots of other tools including a tent a rool of bacon flour and many other things one other tool this was called a gold cradle or rocker box it was used to

<p>about one year after the start of the gold rush there were more rushes to the soronding vallys most of the miners dropped mosly evrything and went to the suronding vallys in the feverish serach for gold.</p>
<h1 id="p01">Later on in the gold rush </h1>

<p>next the gold rush moved further south to alexarndra at the clutha river also it went to cromwel arowtown and queenstown once again most people from duniden went to the gold feilds thee was lots of robbers at the goldfeilds so the miners had to be very quiet abot there gold </p>
<h1 id="p01">robers and claim jumpers</h1>
<p>robers were the people that stole gold off the miners this is one reason why the miners had to keep quiet about there gold
  claim jumpers were the other type of rober claim jumpers usually came in groups ulike robbers when claim jummpers herad about sombody that was finding lots of gold
they would go to there claim and either the miner would give it up or the claim jumpers would take it by force whitch did not usually end well for he miners.   </p>
